MERN Assignments (HTML and CSS Tasks)

Hello everyone,
I have recently embarked on a journey to learn about Web Development by enrolling in the MERN Stack Industrial Course organized by my college. I am very enthusiastic about acquiring new knowledge, facing challenges, and enhancing my coding skills.
In this regard, I would like to share some of the HTML and CSS tasks that were assigned to us for practice and to reinforce the concepts taught in the course.
Stay tuned for more exciting updates!!
